# privateLeague

Learning Rust by making a private league management software.

It has shitty naming, shitty design but well, it gets to something... 

# MVP reached

Finally, this got the MVP status. 
- Everything is serialized in JSON after each action (to prevent data loss after a crash).
- Games can be added and if mistakes were made all games of a match can be cleared (get rekt, if you made the mistake in the third game. have fun to write each of the three games again...)
- races can be given
- game duration can be given
